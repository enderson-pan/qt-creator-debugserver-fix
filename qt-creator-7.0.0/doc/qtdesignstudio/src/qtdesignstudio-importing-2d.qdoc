    \title Importing 2D Assets

    You can import 2D assets, such as images, fonts, and sound files, to \QDS to
    use them in your projects.

    To import an asset, drag-and-drop the external file containing the asset from,
    for example, File Explorer on Windows, to \uicontrol {Form Editor},
    \uicontrol Navigator, or \uicontrol {Text Editor}. Alternatively, select
    \uicontrol Assets > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    and follow the instructions in the \uicontrol {Asset Import} dialog. You can
    also multiselect several external asset files to drag-and-drop them to
    \QDS simultaneously.

    The imported images will appear in \uicontrol Assets.
    If you initiate the import by dragging the assets to \uicontrol {Form Editor},
    they are also added to your projects as image components, and you can view
    them in \uicontrol {Form Editor} and \uicontrol Navigator. If you drag an
    external font file to \uicontrol {Form Editor}, it will be added to your
    project as a text component. Other imported assets, such as sound files,
    will only appear in \uicontrol Assets, and you can then
    drag-and-drop them to a suitable view.

    \section1 Importing Designs From Other Design Tools

    \image studio-imported-assets.png "UI imported into Qt Design Studio"

    \QB enables you to export assets and then import them to a \QDS project
    as image and QML files for editing in \l {Form Editor}. If you make changes
    to your design in the design tool that you originally used to create it,
    you can merge the changes into existing QML files without overwriting the
    changes you have made in \QDS. For more information, see
    \l {Exporting from Design Tools}.

    \note Attempting to import assets exported on another system might fail.

    The following instructions use an empty project as an example. For more
    information about the options you have, see
    \l {Creating Projects}.

    To import assets exported in \QB to \QDS projects:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Project} >
            \uicontrol General > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application - Empty} >
            \uicontrol Choose, and follow the instructions of the wizard to
            create an empty project.
        \li In \uicontrol Projects, double-click \e Screen01.ui.qml to move to
            the Design mode.
        \li Select \uicontrol Assets > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
            .
        \li Select the folder where you exported the assets.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Exported Assets (*.metadata)} in the dropdown
            menu to filter \e .metadata files.
        \li Select a \e .metadata file to import, and then select
            \uicontrol Open.
        \li Select \uicontrol Details next to the
            \uicontrol {Metadata Import Paths} field to display the path where
            the metadata is imported from.
            \image studio-import-metadata.png "Asset Import dialog"
        \li Select \uicontrol Details next to the
            \uicontrol {QML/Asset Export Paths} field to display the paths to
            copy the assets to.
        \li In the \uicontrol QML field, you can change the folder to copy the
            QML files to.
        \li In the \uicontrol Assets field, you can change the folder to copy
            the image files to.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Create sub directory for each metadata}
            check box to copy the directory structure from the metadata file
            to \QDS.
        \li Deselect the \uicontrol {Import assets} check box if you only want
            to create QML files.
        \li Deselect the \uicontrol {Generate QML} check box if you only
            want to import assets.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Merge QML} check box if you have imported the
            assets before and want to merge the changes into existing QML files
            instead of overwriting the existing files.
        \li Select \uicontrol Import to import the QML files and assets. This
            might take a little while for complex projects.
    \endlist

    The imported assets are displayed in \uicontrol Assets
    as PNG images. The components that you specified in the design tool are
    displayed in \uicontrol Components > \uicontrol {My Components} as well as
    in the \uicontrol Projects view as separate QML files. To start using them,
    drag-and-drop them from \uicontrol Components to \uicontrol {Form Editor} or
    \l Navigator.

    \note The layer that was the bottom layer in the design tool becames the top
    layer in \uicontrol Navigator to reflect the QML code model. You
    can view the QML code in \l{Text Editor}.

    After importing the metadata files, wait a few moments to allow all
    imported assets to appear in your project files before selecting your
    metadata filename from \uicontrol Assets > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    .

    If asset importer conflicts, warnings, and errors are displayed in the
    \uicontrol {Asset Import} dialog while importing, fix the issues in
    design tool and export the assets again.
